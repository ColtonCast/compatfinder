# compatfinder

much to do! 

need to add/fix static css for html pages
need to post survey data to either memory and or friends.js json using fs.write maybe

need to compare array data from submitted array to friends list data and compare

arrayA = user.   arrayB = json data

arrayA[i]  -  arrayB[i] * (-1) => ArrayC[i]

cycle user submitted data through all json data

 reduce(ArrayC[]) = #. take closes # as the result or closest match. send that data to the user.
